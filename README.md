# Effective Java

This project is built from the sources from the book "Effective Java Second Edition", written by Joshua Bloch.

They are modified and restructured only structurally, as below:
 
    package names.
    grouping of items into common packages
    test cases extracted out

This project is similar to https://github.com/marhan/effective-java-examples
